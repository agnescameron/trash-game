Hello and welcome to 'let's play, waste at MIT'
You are the new head of waste management at the Media Lab.
We're glad to have you on the team!


Right now, the biggest challenge that the lab is facing is landfill
100% of our waste gets thrown away, and that's a problem!

it can be hard to get people to listen...
but we're sure you'll be fine!
the lab is pretty new, and is set to grow a lot in the coming months
...so you'll need to hire new staff to deal with the extra waste

Also: if you do a good job here, we'll ask you to expand to more buildings on campus
